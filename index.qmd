## Projects

### 1. Airline Network Analysis
This project explores airline connectivity using network visualization techniques. Airports are represented as nodes and flight routes as edges, allowing the structure of the airline network to be examined. The visualization highlights major hubs, connectivity patterns, and the overall structure of air travel networks.
